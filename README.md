# CleanMassachusetts

A project to stop Globe Direct from illegally dumping hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 into our atmosphere

Or: A quick way to quickly unsubscribe from Globe Direct circulars.

## The short short story

Globe Direct dumps about a million circulars on Massachusetts
lawns. They typically don't honor opt-out requests. These actions
violate Massachusetts littering laws (MGL 270§16), trespass laws
(M.G.L. Ch. 266§120), and vandalism laws
(M.G.L. Ch. 266§126B,127). Many citizens and towns in Massachusetts
have petitioned Globe Direct to stop, but with only limited
success. In the words of a Globe employee, citizens of Massachusetts
are their product, not their costumer.

There is a simple, effective way to unsubscribe from Globe Direct, and
to hopefully put them out of business for good. Contact (and boycott)
their advertisers. If advertising in Globe Direct costs more business
than it generates, the problem will be stopped at the source.

This page compiles a list of Globe Direct advertisers who are
knowingly violating Massachusetts Law. All of these advertisers have
had their legal departments contacted, were given over a month's
notice, and have chosen to either not respond, or to decline to stop
litering Massachusetts lawns.

Leaving negative reviews for these organizations is one of the
fastest, cheapest ways you can help the Massachusetts environment and
the Massachusetts economy. A few negative reviews are worth about a
thousand tons of CO2. It's worth more than recycling for the rest of
your life.
